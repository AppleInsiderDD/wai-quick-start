## Assess key issues impacting accessibility

Key stakeholders play an important role in ensuring an awareness of the issues and their relevance.

## Engage with people with disabilities

People with disabilities are often unaware of accessibility features, so that they are being infrequently demanded. Involving them in awareness-raising campaigns and discussion is equally important to ensure backing and a societal contract. @@@

People with disabilities will help build understanding of the barriers faced and what accommodations can help in removing them. Stories of how people with disabilities use the web can also help develop understanding of the principles of and need for web accessibility. Use these stories as cases studies when building awareness and seeking backing.

## Engage senior stakeholders and decision makers

Individual project staff might want to increase accessibility efforts but lack the resources to do so. Backing from senior stakeholders and decision makers will help stimulate change and ensure resources are available for accessibility activities. Target these people with awareness-raising campaigns and discussion to provide an appreciation for the value and importance of accessibility. This will impact on broad change and progress.

Build a business case for web accessibility that is most relevant to the organization. Seek to align the rationale for adopting accessibility with core business objectives and motivations.
